An open source rpg! Trial of the Alchymer.

Like every foolish roguelike author, I looked at several open source roguelike projects and decided they weren't weird enough for my needs. Though currently a work in progress, TotA boasts a strange and versatile rpg framework with an emphasis on mutability.
